# ACEITLab
Online Networking Lab

An Open Source project to create an online lab environment for networking students.

ACEITLab provides tenants (read Students) with the ability to create, configure, and control remote virtual resources such as VMs, Networks, Volumes, and Snapshots.

Access to those VMs is integrated into the browser via the excellent Guacamole project (http://guac-dev.org/).

Though currently focused on KVM and the libvirt-php API (https://libvirt.org/php/), this project can be expanded to other hypervisors through its abstraction model and the addition of further libraries.

Instructor video can be viewed at https://youtu.be/a9m9kss7klQ with more videos to come.
